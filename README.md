# Impacts on Society
Name: Ethics of Robotics and Conputer Programming
Grade Level: 7-8 
Ethics of robots is a guided classroom discussion that allows students to critically think about technology and how it serves but can potentially sacrifice or cause harm as well. It is a pro and con discussion based on different types of robots and computer programming. This includes students conducting their own research and coming up with their own reasoning and rationale. The lesson plan is designed to encourage students to understand the power of computer programming and the cabiibilty under different circumstances. Computer Programming has and continues to be a major part of our modern lives, from iPhone facial recognition to self-driving vehicles that also require programming however at the same time artifical intelligence has the ability to malfunction or to fail on the expense of someone's life. Computer programming plays a huge role from protecting alarm systems, privacy, etc. but what happens when someone is able to hack into them or breach data?  Furthermore, this resource of computer programming and sources such as humanoids affect society based on socioeconomic status as well and equitable reseources, can robots from Lockheed Martin also create or do they create robots to help people with disabilities or is it for military purposes only? These are the questions that are the bases of discussing ethic of Robotics and Computer Programming.
