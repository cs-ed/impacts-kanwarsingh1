# Impacts on Society
Name: Ethics of Robotics and Conputer Programming
Grade Level: 7-8 
Ethics of robots is a guided classroom discussion that allows students to critically think about technology and how it serves but can potentially sacrifice or cause harm as well. It is a pro and con discussion based on different types of robots and computer programming. This includes students conducting their own research and coming up with their own reasoning and rationale. The lesson plan is designed to encourage students to understand the power of computer programming and the cabiibilty under different circumstances. Computer Programming has and continues to be a major part of our modern lives, from iPhone facial recognition to self-driving vehicles that also require programming however at the same time artifical intelligence has the ability to malfunction or to fail on the expense of someone's life. Computer programming plays a huge role from protecting alarm systems, privacy, etc. but what happens when someone is able to hack into them or breach data?  Furthermore, this resource of computer programming and sources such as humanoids affect society based on socioeconomic status as well and equitable reseources, can robots from Lockheed Martin also create or do they create robots to help people with disabilities or is it for military purposes only? These are the questions that are the bases of discussing ethic of Robotics and Computer Programming. Students will be able to effectively describe and challenge the role of robots and the purpose they serve and by doing so they will in result anyalyze the impact computing has on society. 

## Plan
Students will 

### Learning Objectives
According to Blooms Taxonomy, strong learning takes place in a hierarchal classification (2021). Considering Blooms taxonomy, the 6 categories include creating, evaluating, analyzing, applying, understanding, and remembering (Forehand, 2010). The lesson plan will cover each of the aforementioned:
1. Creating: the lesson will discuss mechanisms such as robots as the foundational knowledge and center piece of discussion
2. Evaluating: Students will evaluate the cabilbility of each computer programmed robot
3. Analyze: Students will weigh the pro's and con's of the robots and its affects on society. 
4. Applying: Students will be able to apply different scenerios and realities of the benefitis and disadvantages of the robots. How can it help? If there is potential harm, then how can it be overcome? Different solutions will be applied. 
5. Understanding: Students will understand how some sort of protections can be made with contracts or operating in "good faith" and explore other avenues of how ethics and moral is carried out. This is important to note, that students will not be judged or graded based on their reasoning. 
6. Remembering: The intention of this lesson is that students keep computer programming and the value of computer programming in their minds and when they come across different forms of computer programming, that they are aware of pro's and con's or that they think about the pro's and con's


### Learning Activities
Students will have access to Google Slides and this will be a two day lesson. The first day, a guided discussion will be held presenting different forms of robots. Students will be able to learn about them and watch videos as a class. This is done as a whole to establish the same foundational groundwork. The discussion and videos are used to show how theory and practice come together. Students may have background knowledge, and that is when the classroom discussion becomes richer along with students sharing their thoughts and questioning the mechanisms of the robots. The Google slides will cover the following robots and pose the following questions. 

Following idea from brainstorm activity. 
- Industrial Robots: serve the function of manufacturing. They are programmable and capable of carrying out tasks. To help you remember you can think of robots working in factories. How will this affect employment?
- Insect robots: can fly, walk, and drift. They are very tiny and can serve multiple causes such as helping in the agricultural industry, air pollutants, or even rescue missions. Let's explore some potential benefits. How can this violate privacy? Does it?
- Android Robots typically resemble a human. Some functions include: human like speech and interactions, webcams, homes and workplaces. Humanoids  Would you leave this robot at home? Would it serve any benefit to geographic areas with higher crime? Could it prevent robberies or would someone be able to hack the robot? How does a mannequin or test dummy (used when testing cars) relate to this?
- Powered Exoskeleton robots mimic and enhance the human body. This can include giving it more power and strength or do tasks that we typically do using machinery. How would this impact our lifestyle? Would it play a role in the military (reduce strain on the body), will this help our country? What about those that can’t afford the robots? Is it humane to use this as a form of defense? Can this be used in any other way? Would there be any use of this on animals?
- Swarm Robots are typically an army of robots designed for a task. http://www.techferry.com/articles/swarm-intelligence.html What are the pros and cons of Swarm Robots?
- Equity in Computer Programming: Healthcare needs, Apps, Online Banking, etc. 
- Artifical Intelligence - Is it good or bad? 


The second day includes students researching the robots on their own and answering the questions again, but in a written format where they analyze, apply and understand research they conducted to prove pro's and con's of computer programming/robotics. 
### Assessment

Students will be assessed based on their rationale for their written work. If they are able to explain their work, then they will earn the credit. Students with only opinions and no research will have points taken off. 

### Outcomes
The lesson plan is designed to promote inclusion and equitable resources. Using exoskeletons or humanoids to replace manual labor jobs affects employment, but when we realistically look at who's employment is it really affecting? Does everyone have access to becoming financially secure and who is being pushed out? What are some solutions? Who can afford these resources? Is artificial intelligence racist or can it be, has it been? What is the margin of error? When we typically (at least in my career) talk about robotics, and computer programming we shed light on the possibilities and potential of computer science because it is true, we are going into space, there is new and advanced cars developing but at the same time can we continue to develop the innovations and be fair to everyone. I believe there are advancements and solutions and this generation of future scholars are capable of making our future equitable and inclusive.
